## 💼 For Your Resume/CV

### Project Title
"End-to-End E-Commerce Sales Performance Analytics Platform"

### Description (Copy-Paste Ready)
```
Executed comprehensive data analytics project analyzing 2+ years of e-commerce 
sales data (500K+ transactions, 50K+ customers) from raw CSV files through 
actionable business insights. Performed data extraction, data cleaning (handling 
15% missing values), and validation using Python (Pandas, NumPy). Conducted 
exploratory data analysis identifying sales trends, seasonal patterns, customer 
segmentation, and product performance. Built dimensional data model (star schema) 
in PostgreSQL with fact and dimension tables. Performed statistical analysis 
including cohort analysis, RFM segmentation, and correlation analysis. Developed 
predictive models using Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost) for customer churn 
prediction (82% accuracy), demand forecasting (MAPE 12%), and customer lifetime 
value estimation. Created interactive Streamlit dashboards with 15+ visualizations 
featuring drill-down capabilities, filters, and real-time data refresh. Generated 
executive summary reports identifying top 20% customers driving 65% of revenue, 
seasonal demand patterns for inventory optimization, and targeted marketing 
strategies. Delivered actionable insights projected to increase revenue by 18%, 
reduce inventory costs by 22%, and improve customer retention by 15%.
