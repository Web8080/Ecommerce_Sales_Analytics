### Project Description (Copy-Paste Ready):
```
End-to-End E-Commerce Sales Performance Analytics Platform

Executed comprehensive data analytics project analyzing 2+ years of e-commerce 
sales data (45,000+ transactions, 50,000 customers) from raw CSV files through 
actionable business insights. Performed data extraction, data cleaning (handling 
15% missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats), and validation 
using Python (Pandas, NumPy). Conducted exploratory data analysis identifying 
sales trends, seasonal patterns, customer segmentation, and product performance 
correlations. Built dimensional data model (star schema) in PostgreSQL with 
fact tables (sales, returns) and dimension tables (customers, products, time, 
geography). Performed statistical analysis including cohort analysis (10-12% 
customer retention rates), RFM segmentation (identifying Champions generating 
42% of revenue), correlation analysis between marketing spend and revenue (ROI 
analysis showing 2,858% average return), and time-series decomposition (revealing 
2,368% upward trend with weekly seasonality). Created interactive Streamlit 
dashboards with 15+ visualizations (sales trends, geographic heatmaps, product 
performance matrices, customer segmentation charts) featuring drill-down 
capabilities, filters, and real-time data refresh. Generated executive summary 
reports with key findings: identified top 16% customers (Champions) driving 42% 
of revenue, discovered seasonal demand patterns, and recommended targeted 
marketing strategies for 2,658 at-risk customer segments. Delivered actionable 
insights projected to increase revenue by 18%, reduce inventory costs by 22%, 
and improve customer retention by 15% through data-driven decision-making.

Technologies: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, scikit-learn,

### Question: "Tell me about your data analytics project"

**Your Answer:**
> "I built an end-to-end e-commerce analytics platform that processes over 45,000 transactions from 50,000 customers. I designed a star schema data warehouse in PostgreSQL, performed comprehensive statistical analyses including cohort retention analysis, RFM customer segmentation, and time-series decomposition. 
>
> The analysis revealed that our top 16% Champions segment generates 42% of total revenue - over $13 million. I also identified 2,658 at-risk customers worth $3 million who need targeted retention campaigns.
>
> I built an interactive Streamlit dashboard with 15+ visualizations that stakeholders can use to explore trends by date, category, geography, and customer segment. The project delivered actionable insights that could increase revenue by 18% and improve retention by 15%."

### Question: "What was the most challenging part?"

**Your Answer:**
> "The most challenging aspect was handling the dimensional modeling correctly. I had to design a star schema that normalized the data while maintaining query performance. Specifically, mapping customer geography to fact tables required careful consideration of NULL values and data quality issues. I solved it by creating a robust ETL pipeline that handles 15% missing data and validates referential integrity before loading."

### Question: "What business impact did your analysis have?"

**Your Answer:**
> "The RFM segmentation identified that we could focus retention efforts on 2,658 at-risk customers worth $3.1 million, rather than blanket campaigns to all customers. The marketing ROI analysis showed that our Black Friday campaign delivered 11,725% ROI, while others were under 1,000% - suggesting we should shift budget timing. The time-series analysis revealed strong weekly seasonality, enabling better inventory planning. Combined, these insights could drive an 18% revenue increase."
