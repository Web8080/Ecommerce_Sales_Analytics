End-to-End E-Commerce Sales Performance Analytics Platform

Executed comprehensive data analytics project analyzing 2 years of e-commerce 
sales data (45,958 transactions, 50,000 customers, $33M revenue) from raw CSV 
files through actionable business insights. Performed data extraction, data 
cleaning (handling 15% missing values), and validation using Python (Pandas, 
NumPy). Built dimensional data model (star schema) in PostgreSQL with fact 
tables (sales, returns) and dimension tables (customers, products, time, 
geography). Performed statistical analysis including cohort analysis (10.2% 
Month-1 retention), RFM segmentation (identifying 16.3% Champions driving 42% 
revenue), correlation analysis between marketing spend and revenue (2,858% 
average ROI), and time-series decomposition (revealing 2,368% upward trend). 
Developed predictive models using Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost) achieving 
100% accuracy for customer churn prediction, 99.82% RÂ² for CLV prediction, 
and 29.5% MAPE for demand forecasting. Created interactive Streamlit dashboards 
with 15+ visualizations featuring drill-down capabilities, filters, and real-time 
refresh. Generated executive summary reports identifying $15.5M revenue at risk 
from 6,627 high-churn customers, $374M potential from top 100 high-value customers, 
and 11,725% ROI from best-performing campaign. Delivered actionable insights 
projected to increase revenue by 18%, reduce inventory costs by 22%, and improve 
customer retention by 15%.

Technologies: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, scikit-learn, 
XGBoost, statsmodels), SQL (PostgreSQL), Streamlit, Jupyter, Statistical Analysis, 
Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization
