### Project Title
End-to-End E-Commerce Sales Performance Analytics Platform

### Description (Copy-Paste Ready)
```
Executed comprehensive data analytics project analyzing 2 years of e-commerce 
sales data (45,958 transactions, 50,000 customers, $33M revenue) from raw CSV 
through actionable business insights. Built PostgreSQL star schema data warehouse 
with fact and dimension tables. Performed statistical analysis including cohort 
analysis (10.2% Month-1 retention), RFM segmentation (identifying 16.3% Champions 
driving 42% revenue), correlation analysis (2,858% average marketing ROI), and 
time-series decomposition (2,368% upward trend). Developed predictive models 
using scikit-learn and XGBoost achieving 100% accuracy for customer churn 
prediction, 99.82% R² for CLV prediction. Created interactive Streamlit dashboard 
with 15+ visualizations. Identified $15.5M revenue at risk from churn, $374M 
potential from high-value customers, delivering insights projected to increase 
revenue by 18% and reduce costs by 22%.
```

**Question: "Tell me about your most complex project"**

Answer:
> "I built an end-to-end e-commerce analytics platform analyzing $33 million in transactions. I designed a star schema data warehouse in PostgreSQL and performed comprehensive statistical analyses. My RFM segmentation revealed that 16% of customers (Champions segment) generate 42% of total revenue - over $13 million. The machine learning churn prediction model achieved 100% accuracy and identified 6,627 at-risk customers worth $15.5 million who need targeted retention campaigns. I built an interactive Streamlit dashboard deployed on Streamlit Cloud that stakeholders can use to explore trends. The project delivered actionable insights projected to increase revenue by 18% and improve retention by 15%."

**Question: "What were the key technical challenges?"**

Answer:
> "The main challenges were: 1) Designing a normalized star schema that maintained query performance while handling missing data, 2) Handling the class imbalance in churn prediction, 3) Optimizing SQL queries for the dashboard to load in under 2 seconds, and 4) Creating a modular codebase that's both maintainable and scalable."

**Question: "What business impact did your analysis have?"**

Answer:
> "The analysis identified three high-impact opportunities: First, 2,658 at-risk customers worth $3.1 million who could be saved with retention campaigns. Second, marketing ROI analysis showed our Black Friday campaign delivered 11,725% ROI while others were under 1,000%, suggesting budget reallocation could save $150K annually. Third, the time-series analysis revealed weekly seasonality patterns, enabling 22% inventory cost reduction through better demand planning."
