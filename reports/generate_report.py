##  Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Customer Segmentation Reveals Revenue Concentration

**Finding:** VIP customers (top tier) represent significant revenue concentration.

"""
    
    # Add segment analysis
    for _, row in segment_revenue.iterrows():
        report += f"- **{row['customer_segment']}**: {row['customer_pct']:.1f}% of customers generate {row['revenue_pct']:.1f}% of revenue\n"
    
    report += f"""

** Critical Insight:** {segment_revenue[segment_revenue['customer_segment']=='VIP']['customer_pct'].values[0]:.1f}% of customers (VIP segment) generate {segment_revenue[segment_revenue['customer_segment']=='VIP']['revenue_pct'].values[0]:.1f}% of total revenue.

**Recommendation:** Implement premium retention programs for VIP customers with personalized offers, dedicated support, and exclusive benefits.

### 2. Product Category Performance

**Top 5 Categories by Revenue:**

"""
    
    for i, (category, revenue) in enumerate(top_categories.items(), 1):
        report += f"{i}. **{category}**: ${revenue:,.2f}\n"
    
    report += f"""

**Recommendation:** 
- Increase marketing spend on top-performing categories
- Cross-sell complementary products within these categories
- Optimize inventory allocation based on performance

---

### 3. Geographic Market Opportunities

**Top Markets by Revenue:**

"""
    
    for i, (country, revenue) in enumerate(top_countries.items(), 1):
        pct = (revenue / total_revenue * 100)
        report += f"{i}. **{country}**: ${revenue:,.2f} ({pct:.1f}% of total)\n"
    
    report += f"""
